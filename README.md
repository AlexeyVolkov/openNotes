# Open Notes - React Notes App Boilerplate

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Quick start

In the project directory, you can run: `npm install && npm start` Runs the app
in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Motivation

There are projects like [Write.as](https://write.as),
[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org), [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com) to
save and share plain notes.

Making their clone looking at their code could be confusing.

## Solution

This React Notes App playground has features like debounced input, local
storage, offline-ready app and native share option. It's simple and clear.
