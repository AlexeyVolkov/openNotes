# OpenNote

## Your Open-Source Note-Taking Companion

OpenNote is an open-source, offline-capable note-taking application, designed to capture and share your ideas freely and efficiently, anytime, anywhere. It was developed using [React](https://reactjs.org).

## Quick Start

Getting started with OpenNote is as easy as running a few commands. In your project directory, simply run:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

This will start the app in development mode. You can then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to view it.

## Why OpenNote?

While there are numerous note-taking solutions available such as [Write.as](https://write.as), [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org), and [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com), navigating and learning from their codebases can be challenging due to their complexity.

## Our Solution

OpenNote is a minimalist yet feature-rich note-taking platform that serves as an excellent starting point for those interested in building their own note-taking applications. It includes features such as debounced input, local storage, offline capability, and native share option, all bundled in a clean and comprehensible codebase.
